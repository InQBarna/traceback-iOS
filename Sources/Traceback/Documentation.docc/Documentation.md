# ``Traceback``

* **Post-install deep link detection**

    Automatically detect and handle links that triggered app installation, even after App Store download and install.

* **Universal link handling**

    Extract and process deep link parameters from universal links, whether from post-install or direct app-opening scenarios.

    Built-in validation tools to ensure proper configuration and troubleshoot setup issues.
